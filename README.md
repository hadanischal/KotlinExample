# KotlinExample

## Overview:
* Now that Google has embraced Kotlin—making it an official language on Android— cross-platform development has become a lot simpler. 
* The striking similarities between Swift and Kotlin make maintaining an app across iOS and Android more intuitive. 
* Highlighting the similarities and differences between Kotlin and Swift by looking at Swift code examples and walking through how to code Kotlin equivalents. 

* Kotlin is a concise new programming language that's used for Android development and in other Java-based environments.
* Among its many benefits, Kotlin is 100% compatible with Java and is fully supported by Google. 

## Objective:
* Comprehensive overview of the most essential features of Kotlin, specifically the version that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). 
* Project setup, through rudimentary syntax, to working with variables and creating custom classes. 
* Display program flow with functions, loops, conditional statements, and try/catch exception handling. 
* Display how to manage data in memory with fixed-size arrays and dynamic data collections: lists, sets, and maps. 
* Describes how to implement inheritance-a key feature of reusable, object-oriented code-with classes, interfaces, anonymous objects, and anonymous functions (aka lambda expressions).
* Demonstrate working with simple values and complex objects such as data collections.
* Show you how to manage programming flow with conditional statements and loops.
* Explore a variety of ways to create reusable code in Kotlin with functions, classes, interfaces, enumerations, and more.
